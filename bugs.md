## Incorrect letter
So the deal is, currently, the letter will will eventually be highlighted as correct, because eventually it IS correct. So, that means in the code, we need to specify if the typed letter is EVER incorrect, and if it is, then don't change the class to correct once it's typed correctly.

- [ ] Currently registers Shift as incorrectly typed letter
