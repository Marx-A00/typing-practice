# Typing Practice Application

## Overview
My main goal is to create a typing practice application using vanilla JavaScript. I want this project to be simple and minimalistic. Addititionally, I want the application to help people who use the DVORAK keyboard layout, and also have ergonmic keyboards/ split layouts.

## Features

### Main Page
The main page should contain:

- A paragraph of text that the user will need to type.
- A picture of a keyboard, which highlights the key that the user needs to type.

#### Paragraphs
Paragraphs should:
- have three classes:
    - `text-display` - for the paragraph text
    - `text-display-highlight` - for the highlighted key
    - `text-display-correct` - for the correct key
- have a `data-key` attribute, which is the key that the user needs to type.





- Application will have a paragraph of text that the user will need to type.
- Application will have a picture of a keyboard, which highlights the key that the user needs to type.
